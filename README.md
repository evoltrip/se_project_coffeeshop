# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

Add your ideas here : I'm new to software engineering, I don't have any idea's. I think for a second project it gives a good group of new skills to apply. I still kinda need help because im starting to learn new things, I used to code in middle school and high school.
